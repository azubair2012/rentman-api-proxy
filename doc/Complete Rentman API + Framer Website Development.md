# Complete Rentman API + Framer Website Development Workflow

A comprehensive phase-by-phase workflow for developing your complete real estate website using Cursor IDE, integrating the Rentman API with your Framer featured properties section and manual property selection system.

## Phase 1: Enhanced Project Setup \& Requirements

### 1.1 Environment Setup

**Download and Configure Cursor IDE**

- Install Cursor IDE from the official website and configure your workspace with proper folder structure[^1]
- Set up Git integration for version control and collaborative development[^1]
- Configure AI-assisted code completion and custom prompts for property-related development[^1]

**Project Structure Creation**

```
rentman-property-site/
├── cloudflare-worker/
├── framer-site/
├── docs/
└── assets/
```


### 1.2 Modified Requirements Gathering

**Featured Properties Selection Mechanism**

- Create an admin interface for selecting featured properties from the complete property list[^1]
- Implement a toggle system to mark/unmark properties as featured since the Rentman API doesn't provide built-in featured property filtering[^1]
- Design a property management dashboard for easy featured property control[^1]

**Data Storage Strategy**

- Establish a separate database/storage system to track featured property selections using Cloudflare KV storage[^1]
- Create mapping between Rentman property references and featured status[^1]
- Implement persistence for featured property selections across sessions[^1]


## Phase 2: Enhanced Backend Development (Cloudflare Workers)

### 2.1 Extended API Middleware Architecture

**Core API Endpoints**

```
/api/properties - Retrieve all properties from Rentman API
/api/properties/featured - Get currently featured properties
/api/properties/featured/toggle - Toggle featured status for specific properties
/api/admin/properties - Admin interface for property management
```

**Featured Properties Management System**

```javascript
// Enhanced Worker structure for featured property management
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    const path = url.pathname;
    
    switch (path) {
      case '/api/properties':
        return await getAllProperties(request, env);
      case '/api/properties/featured':
        return await getFeaturedProperties(request, env);
      case '/api/properties/featured/toggle':
        return await toggleFeaturedStatus(request, env);
      case '/api/admin/properties':
        return await getAdminPropertyList(request, env);
    }
  }
};
```


### 2.2 Cloudflare Worker Setup

**Initialize Project**

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest rentman-api-proxy
cd rentman-api-proxy
```

**Configure Development Environment**

- Set up local development with Wrangler CLI for serverless deployment[^1]
- Create `.dev.vars` file for local API tokens and environment variables[^1]
- Configure CORS headers for Framer integration and cross-origin requests[^1]


### 2.3 Data Storage Implementation

**Cloudflare KV Storage for Featured Properties**

- Utilize Cloudflare KV storage to maintain featured property selections with high availability[^1]
- Store featured property IDs with metadata and timestamps for audit trails[^1]
- Implement backup and recovery mechanisms for featured selections[^1]

**Featured Properties Logic**

- Fetch all properties from Rentman API using the `/propertyadvertising.php` endpoint[^1]
- Cross-reference property IDs with stored featured selections in KV storage[^1]
- Return enhanced property objects with featured status indicators[^1]


## Phase 3: Admin Interface Development

### 3.1 Property Management Dashboard

**Admin Panel Features**

- Visual property grid with toggle switches for featured status management[^1]
- Search and filter capabilities for easy property location within large portfolios[^1]
- Bulk selection tools for managing multiple featured properties simultaneously[^1]
- Preview of how featured properties will appear on the website[^1]

**User Interface Design**

- Clean, intuitive dashboard design for property management with responsive layout[^1]
- Visual indicators showing current featured status using clear UI elements[^1]
- Real-time updates when featured status changes without page refresh[^1]
- Mobile-responsive design for property management on various devices[^1]


### 3.2 Property Selection Controls

**Toggle Interface Implementation**

- Individual property cards with featured toggle switches for easy selection[^1]
- Visual feedback for feature selection changes with immediate confirmation[^1]
- Confirmation dialogs for important featured property changes to prevent accidents[^1]
- Batch operations for selecting multiple properties as featured efficiently[^1]


## Phase 4: Enhanced Framer Integration

### 4.1 Dynamic Featured Properties Display

**Framer Integration Strategy**
Since the Rentman API doesn't natively support featured properties, implement a hybrid approach with manual selection:

**Option A: Real-time Fetch Integration**

- Connect Framer Fetch to your `/api/properties/featured` endpoint for dynamic updates[^1]
- Display dynamically selected featured properties in real-time without manual updates[^1]
- Automatic updates when featured selections change in admin panel[^1]

**Option B: Enhanced CMS Collection Management**

- Create a custom Framer CMS collection for featured properties with proper field mapping[^1]
- Implement automated sync between your featured selections and Framer CMS[^1]
- Use Framer's filtering capabilities to manage featured property display[^1]


### 4.2 Featured Properties Component Design

**Framer Component Architecture**

- Create reusable property card components with featured property data binding[^1]
- Implement responsive grid layouts for featured properties section across devices[^1]
- Add interactive elements like property detail modals and contact forms[^1]

**Data Mapping Configuration**

```
propref → Property ID
displayaddress → Property Address
displayprice → Property Price
photo1 → Primary Image URL
beds, baths, TYPE → Property Details
```


## Phase 5: Admin Workflow Integration

### 5.1 Property Management Process

**Featured Property Selection Workflow**

1. Admin accesses property management dashboard through secure authentication[^1]
2. Browse complete property portfolio from Rentman API with pagination support[^1]
3. Select properties to feature using toggle controls with visual feedback[^1]
4. Preview featured properties layout before publishing changes[^1]
5. Publish changes to live website featured section with immediate updates[^1]
